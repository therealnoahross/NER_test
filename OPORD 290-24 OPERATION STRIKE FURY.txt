(U) SUMMARY 
(U) Task Organization: Annex A.
1. (U) SITUATION: The U.S. and Republic of Torbia (South Torbia) are allied forccir mutual defense per Reference f (U). U.S. air, land, and naval forces, under the command and control of CJTF-7, deployed to the region in response to continued aggression by the Democratic People’s Republic of Torbia (North Torbia) against South Torbia. North Torbia began deploying its Southern Army toward the international border(IB) on 22 June 2024. On 8 July 2024, the North Torbian 4 (TP) Mechanized Infantry Division (MECHINF DIV) and 6 (TP) MECHINF DIV were staged in assembly areas (AA) along the IB with South Torbia, organized as Division Task Groups (DTG), stockpiling supplies, and conducting offensive rehearsal exercises. VII Corps HQ arrived at APOD HOUSTON (15RTN900771) on 14 July 2024 to serve as CJTF-7’s Combined Forces Land Component. North Torbia began strikes on South Torbia on the night of 25 July 2024 and destroyed six Sing Komm Low Earth Orbit satellites in addition to severing undersea fiber optic data links between South Torbia and other Asian nations. 4 (TP) MECHINF DTG and 6 (TP) MECHINF DTG conducted a full-scale invasion of South Torbia on 26 July 2024. On 27 Jul 2024, 4 (TP) MECHINF DTG attacked to seize Shreveport and other population centers in South Torbia with a high volume of nonpersistent chemical munitions delivered by SSBM and MLRS. North Torbia has demanded the annexation of South Torbian territory heavily populated with large ethnic North Torbian enclaves in northern and northeastern South Torbia, insists on immediate removal of all Western forces from the region, and demands control of South Torbia’s nuclear power resources and infrastructure. The International Community responded with the following actions: the United Nations (UN) issued UNSCR 2581 condemning North Torbia’s invasion of South Torbia and invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the U.S. Ambassador to South Torbia issued a disaster declaration, the President of the United States authorized military operations in the Luzon Island Region, and Australia deployed its 1 (AU) Division to APOD HOUSTON to serve as the VII Corps Reserve. On 30 July 2024, CJTF-7 initiated an air campaign and naval operations against North Torbian forces with 5 Air Expeditionary Task Force (5 AETF) and Carrier Task Force-70 (CTF-70)). South Torbian forces continue to defend in depth to delay North Torbian forces, trading space for time to allow VII Corps Forces to initiate forcible entry operations into AO JAYHAWK and execute multidomain operations to defeat enemy forces.

3.c.6. Phase IV: Defend. TBP upon receipt of 21ABN DIV Order.

3.c.7. Phase V: Attack. TBP upon receipt of 21ABN DIV Order.

  3.d. Scheme of Tactical Deception. The purpose of tactical deception in PH IIIA – IIIB is to deter enemy forces on OBJ TITANS from reinforcing IVO OBJs TIGER and BADGER. MFRC feigns combat power east of OBJ TITANS via decoy emitters along and between PL HAZLENUT and PL ELM. 2-502 feigns a M119 BTRY via decoy emitters south of OBJ TIGER IVO PAA 19. 1-502 emplaces disruption obstacles and decoy emitters from PL ELM to PL DRACAENA in preparation for PH IIIC-IV. In PH IIIC – IV, deception operations emphasize feigning a defense in depth IOT delay enemy counterattack of OBJs TIGER and BADGER, draw enemy forces South, and increase time for FF’s to establish a hasty defense on the OBJs. 1-502 continues to emplace disruption obstacles and decoy emitters from PL DRACAENA to PL STEEL. Subsequent deception operations are contingent upon, and planned in conjunction with, the arrival of the GAF.
